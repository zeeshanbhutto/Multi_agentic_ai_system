# 🧠 Multi Agentic AI System

A modular AI system powered by **OpenAI Agents SDK**, designed to handle **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **SEO** tasks using specialized sub-agents. Each agent works independently with tailored instructions and can be orchestrated to collaborate, enabling scalable full-stack AI-powered web development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **Agentic Architecture**: Built with multiple sub-agents using OpenAI's Agent SDK
- 🎨 **Frontend Expert**: Handles UI/UX using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS
- 🛠️ **Backend Expert**: Manages APIs, databases, authentication, and server frameworks like Express.js or Django
- 📈 **SEO Expert**: Optimizes content, improves search rankings, and ensures metadata & tags are aligned with best practices
- 🧠 **Parent Orchestration Agent**: Delegates user tasks to the appropriate expert agent
- ⚙️ **Highly Configurable**: Easily extendable with new agents or task-specific logic
- 📦 **Deployable**: Designed for cloud deployment (Railway, Vercel, etc.)

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **User Query** → Parent Agent
2. **Parent Agent** evaluates the type of task
